# Hunter Mayer Homework Challenge 2

## Description
In this homework challenge I created a web application from scratch using what I have learned of HTML and CSS so far. I made a portfolio page to showcase myself and some of my past work, and provided links on where to find me. I tried to use flexbox and media queries to design a decent looking webpage, though there are still many improvements that can be made.   

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
